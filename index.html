            <p> 
              I am a 2nd-year PhD student in the Cognition & Perception program at NYU.  
              I work primarily in the 
              <a href="https://www.labdevelopingmind.com/">Lab for the Developing Mind</a> with 
              <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/Moira-Dillon.html">Molly Dillon</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my PhD in 2022. Before that, I was at Temple University, where I studied Philosophy and Psychology,
              and worked as a research assistant with 
              <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/shipley/">Tim Shipley</a> in the 
              <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/risc/">Research in Spatial Cognition (RISC)</a> lab. 
            </p> 

            <p>
              I am broadly interested in the relationship between language and conceptual development.

            <h2> Projects </h2>
            <p> 
              One of my projects, in collaboration with Molly Dillon, investigates the development of concepts of 
              agency and social beings in children, and how these concepts are mapped onto language. 
              <br><br>
              In another project with 
              <a href="https://kidconcepts.org/people">Marjorie Rhodes</a>, 
              I am interested in whether children can pick up cues to typicality 
              through parent language.
