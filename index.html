            <p> 
              I am a PhD student in the Cognition & Perception program at NYU.  
              I work primarily with 
              <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/Moira-Dillon.html">Molly Dillon</a> and 
              <a href="https://kidconcepts.org/people">Marjorie Rhodes</a>.

              I started my PhD in 2022. Before that, I was at Temple University, where I studied Philosophy and Psychology,
              and worked as a research assistant with 
              <a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/shipleythomas">Tim Shipley</a> in the 
              <a href="https://sites.temple.edu/risc/">Research in Spatial Cognition (RISC)</a> lab. 
            </p>

              I am broadly interested in the relationship between conceptual and semantic development. I'm particularly interested in the development of logical reasoning and language. Children learning their first language need to figure out what words in the language map onto the particular concepts they have. But how do they solve this mapping problem for logical words like <i>and</i>,  <i>not</i>, and <i>or</i>, or modals like <i>can</i>, <i>must</i>, and <i>maybe</i>? Unlike other words like <i>dog</i> and <i>jump</i>, these don't have clear referents in the world. Acquiring these words also requires that children have corresponding concepts that they can map these words onto. I'm interested in how children develop these logical concepts, and how they map logical words onto these concepts when they learn a language.

              One of my projects with Molly Dillon looks how language relates to conceptions of agency and experience, and how these are related to information about gaze direction. Another project looks at what information about others' actions adults and children use to make guesses about the meanings of novel words. For example, do people learning novel verbs make use of the <i>efficiency</i>, <i>object-directedness</i>, and <i>path trajectories</i> of others' actions? And does this change if, given the same information, people are learning novel nouns instead?

              In other work with Marjorie Rhodes and <a href = "https://www.ericmandelbaum.com/">Eric Mandelbaum</a>, I'm looking at memory asymmetries in whether children remember denied statements (e.g., "Hippos don't purr"). Negation might require inhibiting a positive statement, and so it requires some cognitive effort to effectively negate a proposition. We are interested in whether young children misremember denied statements as confirmed ones early in development. Previous work has found that, when placed under cognitive load, adults misremember denied statements as true more often than they misremembered confirmed statements as false. We are interested in the development of this phenomena as a window into the mechanisms that explain it.

              A third line of work with <a href = "https://wp.nyu.edu/cournane/">Ailis Cournane</a> and <a href = "https://maximetulling.com/">Maxime Tulling</a> looks at young 2- and 3-year-olds' real-time processing of modals, negation, and confirmation in spoken sentences using a visual world paradigm.
